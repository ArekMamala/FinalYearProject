## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation developed in Galway Mayo Institute of Technology for our fourth year module, Applied Project and Minor Dissertation. ASU Boxing is an application designed specifically aimed for boxers but anyone who wish to begin boxing as a career or exercise are welcome to try it out. This application is developed using the ionic/angular framework and contains a backend server written in SQL, hosted by Amazon Web Services. This application has given each user the ability to create their own account, which is enabled with the implementation of firebase.
<br><br>
<b>The main features of this application:</b>

 - Ability to detect and count various different punches in the space of time decided by the user
 - Displaying the session evalution report at the end of each workout session.
 - Users can schedule events in their calender through the application and load in their events.

## Video Demonstrations
The video demonstrations show how each of us have contributed our parts in the development of this project. We give a run through of the coding, front-end and back-end aspect of the application.

## Reason for Choosing Project
The reasons that we decided to develop this application is because we find this idea very interesting. Sports is a topic that we are all involved in inside of college and out. We came up with this idea when we were at a boxing class when we  couldn't decide who had more power. Itâ€™s a project that we feel will challenge us in developing it and get it working the way we have designed it. 


## Architecture
The application on the phone is going to work with user control. The application is going to count punches, update datasheet, calculate the BPM of user while punching. This app is going to be an alternative to the research of the wearable device. User will have three options within the application.
1. Calculate the number of punches against time.
2. Calculate the number of punches and beats per minute against time.
3. Open data log sheet to view their history. To view their progression.

## To run on android phone
