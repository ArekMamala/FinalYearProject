# ASU Boxing

## Introduction
For our project we wanted to make a wearable wristband that allows a user to keep track of how many punches hit an object, tracking the speed of movement and calculating the beats per minute whilst continuously punching . We also want to connect the wristband to a laptop/phone so the user is able to get all his information tracked and displayed in an elegant and sleek app. 

This project is for Applied Project and Minor in BSc in Computing in Software Development at Galway Mayo Institute of Technology

## Reason for Choosing Project
The reasons that we decided to develop this application is because we find this idea very interesting. Sports is a topic that we are all involved in inside of college and out. We came up with this idea when we were at a boxing class when we  couldn't decide who had more power. Itâ€™s a project that we feel will challenge us in developing it and get it working the way we have designed it. 


## Architecture
The application on the phone is going to work with user control. The application is going to count punches, update datasheet, calculate the BPM of user while punching. This app is going to be an alternative to the research of the wearable device. User will have three options within the application.
1. Calculate the number of punches against time.
2. Calculate the number of punches and beats per minute against time.
3. Open data log sheet to view their history. To view their progression.
